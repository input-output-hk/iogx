# This workflow automates the process of updating all flake inputs and generates 
# a pull request (PR) that auto-merges if all checks pass successfully.
# Note that the workflow begins by deleting the flake.lock file, which is 
# usually unnecessary. However, we've found that this deletion helps prevent 
# lock files from growing excessively large. 
# This may be attributed to potential issues stemming from subflakes within the 
# templates folder, which could potentially lead to recursive complexities.
